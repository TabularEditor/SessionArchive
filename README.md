# Session Archive

This repository contains materials from **conference sessions, community talks, and webinars** delivered by the Tabular Editor Team around Tabular Editor, Microsoft Fabric, Power BI, and related data platform topics.

The purpose of this repository is to provide a **central, easy-to-navigate archive** of session materials, including:
- Presentations (slides)
- Source code and demo projects
- Scripts and utilities
- Supporting assets and references

The structure is intentionally kept **simple and intuitive**, making it easy to find content without prior knowledge of the repository.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized by **session type first**, then by **event or topic**, and finally by **year**.

### Top-level folders

- **`conferences/`**  
  Sessions delivered at larger conferences (e.g. FabCon, FabCon Europe, SQLBits).

- **`community-sessions/`**  
  Talks given at community events and user groups (e.g. MSBIP, regional or local user groups).

- **`webinars/`**  
  Online webinars, typically grouped by topic rather than by event.

## Session Content

Each session is stored in its own folder.

- For **simple sessions** with only a single file (for example a slide deck), the file may be placed directly in the session folder.
- For **sessions with multiple items** (such as slides, source code, demos, or scripts), **all session material is stored in a dedicated folder structure** under the session folder to keep related content together and easy to navigate.

A session folder typically contains one or more of the following subfolders:

- `presentation/` – Slide decks (PPTX / PDF)
- `src/` – Source code (applications, libraries, notebooks, demo projects)
- `scripts/` – Supporting scripts (PowerShell, Python, SQL, Bash, etc.)
- `assets/` – Images, diagrams, or other supporting files
- `README.md` – Short description of the session and its content

Not all sessions contain all folders; the structure is kept flexible on purpose.

---

## Notes

- Older content may not fully follow the current structure and is gradually being aligned.
- Folder and file names aim to be **descriptive rather than strict**, prioritizing readability over rigid conventions.

To find a specific session, start by selecting the **type of session**, followed by the **event or topic**, and then the **year**.
